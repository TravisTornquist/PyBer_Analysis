# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
In order to better understand ride sharing trends in urban, rural, and suburban environments, data was gathered and collated showing driver and fare information in each city type. By analyzing fare amounts, average fares per driver, and average fares per ride, PyBer will be able to make more informed decisions at it seeks to expand operations.

## Results

There are several key differences between urban, suburban, and rural city types. Urban type cities have by far the greatest number of total rides with 1625. This is nearly 3 times the number of rides from suburban type cities (625), and it is 13 times the rides from rural type cities (125). This also means that the total fares collected is greatest in urban type cities with $39854.38. This is about double the fares from suburban type cities ($19,356.33), and almost 10 times that of rural type cities ($4,327.93). Urban type cities also have the greatest number of drivers with 2,405. This is nearly 5 times that of suburban type cities (490) and over 30 times that of rural type cities (78).

Due to the greater number of both rides and drivers, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are lowest in the urban type cities, $24.53 and $16.57 respectively. Suburban and rural type cities do not have drastically different Fares per ride, $30.97 and $34.62 respectively, but the average fare per driver are significantly higher. The average fare per driver in a suburban type city is more than twice that of an urban city at $39.50, and the average fare per driver in a rural type city is over 3 times that of an urban type city at $55.49. This data is summarized in the table below.

When looking at fare data by city type it is clear that urban fares are by far the bigger part of the business. The number of drivers in urban environments makes a ride from PyBer more attractive to customers because it helps keep the average cost of the fare lower than in other types of cities. One recommendation to the business would be to focus on urban markets as PyBer continues to try and expand.

A related recommendation would be to have an ongoing analysis of the PyBer driver pool. 2,405 drivers in urban type cities only took 1,625 rides. If a large number of the driver pool is inactive, PyBer should consider removing them as drivers so that the company can keep track of active drivers. Since the number of drivers help keep fares low and make PyBer an attractive option for customers, the company should know exactly how many active drivers are available in each city type.

Finally, if PyBer wants to expand in suburban and rural city types, the company should recruit more drivers. The average fare per ride in rural and suburban markets is higher in rural and suburban markets. In order to bring down the cost for customers, PyBer should aim to have more drivers available in these markets.
